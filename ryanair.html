    <h2>A summary of Ryanair's climate activity.</h2>

    <h3>Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Rating<sup><a href="#cdp">2</a></sup></h3>

    <p>
        Ryanair currently has a Carbon Disclosure Project(CDP) rating of B (Climate Change).
         A CDP rating is based on how transparent a company is about its climate impact and the actions a company takes to limit its 
         climate impact. There are headings for which every company receives a grade such as Water Security and Climate Change. 
         There are 8 ratings with (excluding F which means did not disclose) with A being the best.B  is the third highest score. 
         For more information, <a href="glossary.html">click here</a>.

    <h3>ISO Certifications</h3>

    <p>
        Ryanair's Dublin facilities hold the following ISO certification : ISO 14001.

<h3>Net Zero by 2050</h3>

<p>
    Ryanair aims to achieve net zero by 2050.
     This means all types of greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon emissions) being produced by Ryanair are either reduced or offsetted. 
     Offsetting in this case means taking greenhouse emissions out of the environment by carbon sinks for example. 
     Carbon sinks such as trees have the ability to remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere. 
     These are the ways Ryanair intend on achieving this:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Ryanair aims to power 12.5% of its flights with sustainable aviation fuel by 2030. 
        Sustainable aviation fuel can be used in planes and can produce up to 80% less carbon emissions. 
        Ryanair has already started purchasing sustainable aviation fuel to help achieve this aim.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Ryanair will purchase at least 150 Boeing 737- MAX-10 aircraft with an option to buy 150 more from Boeing (a company that makes aircraft).
         This new aircraft has more seats while still being 20% more fuel efficient while also 50% quieter than the Boeing 737-800NG. 
         The new Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft will replace up to 50% of the Boeing 737-800NG in Ryanair's fleet.<sup><a href="#iat">3</a></sup>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Ryanair will outfit all of their Boeing 737-800NG with split scimitar winglets. 
        Split scimitar winglets are designed to improve fuel efficiency, reduce noise and reduce NOx (nitrogen oxides) emissions. 
        High levels of NOx emissions can damage vegetation.
        </li>
    <br>
    <li>Ryanair has created a tool that allows customers to voluntarily offset the carbon emissions created by their flight or a partial 
        contribution of â‚¬2. 
        This will not reduce the amount of emissions created by the flight but instead the money raised will be used to support
         environmental projects that aim to help reduce carbon emissions in the area they are operating for example.  
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Ryanair uses measures such as single taxi approach and continuous descent approach to help reduce emission when
         possible during taking off and landing of aircraft.
    </li>
</ol>
<hr>
    <h3>New Technologies</h3>

    <p>
        Ryanair has bought new aircraft and new technologies which release less noise than previous aircraft.
         Research led by the Manchester Metropolitan University has shown that noise from aircrafts landing and taking off can cause heightened
          aggression in birds and potentially have a negative impact on their hearing.

    </p>
<hr>
    <h3>Removing Non-Recyclable Plastic</h3>

    <p>
        Ryanair aims to either replace and remove all non-recyclable plastics from all parts of the company by 2025.
         This will achieved by either identifying areas where plastic can be removed or replacing non-recyclable plastics with 
         recyclable alternatives
