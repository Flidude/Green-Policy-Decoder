    <h3>Carbon Disclosure rating(CDP)</h3>

    <p>
        Next currently has a Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) rating of B (Climate Change) and B (Water Security). A CDP rating is based on how transparent a company is about its climate impact and the actions a company takes to limit its climate impact. There are headings for which every company receives a grade such as Water Security and Climate Change. There are 8 ratings with (excluding F which means did not disclose) with A being the best. A- is the second highest score .For more information,click here. For more information <a href="glossary.html">click here</a>.

    <h3>Carbon Emission Reduction</h3>

    <p>
        Next aims to reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions by 55% and Scope 3 carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. These are the ways Primark intend on achieving this:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Packaging: Next is attempting to reduce its use of plastic and increase the amount of recycled content in its packaging. Next also aims to ensure 100% of its packaging is reusable or recyclable by 2025. Packaging as a whole can release large amounts of carbon emissions.
</li> 
        <br>
        <li>Energy Efficency: Next is improving its energy efficiency across the board. This is being achieved by installing solar panels at its warehouses and installation of LED lighting. LED lighting has already been installed in 55% of stores. Being more energy efficient is an easy way to reduce both carbon and greenhouse gas emissions.

</li>
        <br>
        <li>Waste management: In 2022/2023, Next either recycled, reused or used the waste it created for energy recovery. Energy recovery means converting waste to heat or electricity. It is good for the environment and can help avoid sending waste to landfills. Next is committed to reducing its waste while attempting to improve its recycling and reusing rates.
</li>
        <br>
        <li>Next aims to make the switch and only use 100 percent renewable energy by 2030. Renewable energy comes from sources such as wind that will never run out and can be used repeatedly. They also produce zero or low amounts of greenhouse gas emissions. This aim will be achieved by measures that include only buying electricity from companies that use renewable energy sources.

</li>   
        <br>
        <li>Responsible Sourcing: Next aims to only use materials sourced from responsible sources by 2025. This means that their suppliers are not having a negative impact on the environment for example.</li>
    </ol>
    <hr>
    <h3>Chemical managment</h3>

    <p>
        Next has policies in place to ensure that the chemicals in their products are not damaging the environment and that suppliers are not releasing harmful chemicals into the community during production.
