    <h3>Waste Managmesnt</h3>

    <p>
        Bus Eireann aims to achieve a 25 percent waste reduction by 2025 and a 50 percent reduction by 2030.
        Waste reduction helps to prevent pollution and is crucial to protecting our environment. 
        Bus Eireann has already started taking measures to achieve this. For example,Bus Eireann has purchased waste balers(a machine that compresses waste). 
        Waste balers help reduce waste as they allow companies to recycle more of the waste they produce. 
        Another example of a measure Bus Eireann has taken are waste audits at some of their facilities (waste audits gather information that can be
        used to find out how to improve waste management).

    <h3>Carbon Emission Reduction</h3>

    <p>
        Bus Eireann aims to achieve a 50 percent reduction in Greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. 
        These are the ways that Bus Ã‰ireann intend on achieving this:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>By 2030, they predict that half of their fleet will be made up of emissions free vehicles (for example-electric buses). 
            Bus Eireann has already begun the purchase of emission free vehicles and many are already in use in areas such as Dublin. 
            The diesel vehicles remaining will be be at least Euro VI engine emission standard certified by 2030
            meaning that these vehicles only release a certain amount of emissions. 
            In line with this, Bus Eireann aims that its entire urban fleet will be zero emissions by 2034 and its rural fleet by 2036.</li> 
        <br>
        <li>Bus Eireann aims to ensure that all their facilities are more energy efficient and environmentally friendly by 2025. 
            This means that Bus Eireann have identified areas in their company where their environmental impact or energy efficiency could be improved and have 
            a realistic plan to improve these areas. This means their facilities should reduce the amount of emissions they produce.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bus Eireann has also created the first Irish all electric bus service in Athlone after deploying 11 electric buses in the area. 
            This will help save an estimated 400 tonnes of emissions every year.
            Bus Eireann will also gather information that would be helpful when expanding all electric bus services to other areas.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bus Eireann has also been researching using high-blends biofuels and hydrogen technology in their buses. 
            These fuel sources release zero emissions and vehicles that use them will have a longer driving range and shorter refuelling times than 
            electric powered vehicles.</li>       
    </ol>

    <h3>Increasing Passenger Numbers</h3>

    <p>
        Bus Eireann aims to increase its passenger numbers by at least 30 percent by 2030.
        This will mean more people will be using public buses instead of their own private cars. 
        While a bus does release more emissions than a car there are far more people on it. 
        This means that more cars will be taken off the road resulting in less emissions and traffic.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Sustainable Procurement Strategy</h3>

    <p>
        Bus Eireann aims to introduce a sustainable procurement strategy. 
        This will mean that Bus Eireann will not only think of economic factors when looking at potential suppliers but environmental factors such as, is the 
        company using chemicals harmful to the environment. This will help Bus Eireann promote sustainability to its suppliers and earn ISO 14040 certification.
