        <h2>Common Terms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Biodiversity:This is the variety of plant and animal life in an area and how they interact within 
                habitats and ecosystems (for example lakes and native forests).</li>
                <br>
            <li>Carbon emissions:Carbon emissions are created when particular gases are released into the air from activities like burning fossil fuels for energy. 
                It includes gases like carbon dioxide and methane. This is because they both contain carbon.</li>

                <p>'Carbon emissions' is sometimes used as a shorthand to describe all greenhouse gases.</p>
                <br>
            <li>Alternative fuel sources:Alternative fuels are those fuels or power sources which serve, at least partly, 
                as a substitute for fossil oil sources in the transport sector.</li>

       A cdp rating is a rating of how transparent a company is about their climate impact and the actions they take to limit their climate impact. 
       There are 9 ratings with (F) being the worst and (A) being the best. (A-) is the second highest score.
    </p>
<hr>
    <h3>ISO Certifications</h3>

       An Post holds the ISO 50001 certification.For more information on these ISO certifications click here.
    </p>
<hr>
    <h3>Investment in Sustainability</h3>
    
    <p>
        An Post aims to spend 100 million euros on sustainability capital expenditure by 2025. 
        This means it will invest money in areas that could help the company lower its climate impact.
        An Post spends between 25 million euro and 40 million euro annually on sustainability capital expenditure right now.
    </p>
<hr>
    <h3>Digital Stamp</h3>

    <p>
        An Post has created a digital stamp. This stamp is bought on the An Post app.
        The customer then receives a unique code which can be handwritten on the envelope. This helps to reduce paper use.
    </p>
<hr>
    <h3>The Green Hub</h3>

    <p>
        An Post created the Green Hub. 
        This is a workshop that allows homeowners to stay up to date with ways to make their homes more energy efficient.
    </p>
<hr>
    <h3>Sustainable Product Initiatives</h3>

    <p>
        An Post is attempting to ensure all their products are reusable,recyclable or compostable. 
        For example 93 percent of their prepaid gift boxes are made from recycled materials.
    </p>
<hr>
    <h3>Zero Waste to Landfills</h3>

    <p>
        For the last five years, An Post has sent zero waste to landfills.
        Landfills release large amounts of carbon emissions into the atmosphere. 
        Better alternatives to landfills are to reduce,recycle or reuse waste. 
        To achieve this feat An Post has increased its recycling rate in recent years.
    </p>
<hr>
    <h3>Green Electricity</h3>

    <p>
        Currently,all the electricity used by An Post is green electricity. 
        This means all the electricity comes from renewable sources. 
        This either comes from An Post's own solar panels or from an energy company using renewable sources.
    </p>
<hr>
    <h3>Biodiversity Restoration Goals</h3>

    <p>
        An Post aims to have the same level of biodiversity it had for 1984 (high levels) on its sites again by 2030. 
        These are the ways An Post intends on achieving this:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Create a plan for each building that would improve its biodiversity and then apply it by 2030. 
            For example,placing bird boxes in the eaves of their property's roof to help the local bird population.</li>
            <br>
        <li>All available land will be used for activities to help protect and support endangered species 
            (This is a type of animal,plant or other organisms that could go extinct)</li>
    </ol>
<hr>
    <h3>Carbon Emission Reduction</h3>

    <p>
        An Post aims to reduce carbon emissions by 50 percent by 2025 (2009 baseline) and to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2030. 
        These are the ways that An Post intend on achieving this:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>An Post aims to have 50 percent of its fleet run on alternative fuel sources by 2025. 
            An example of alternative fuel sources in operation are electric powered cars. 
            Alternative fuels tend to release far less emissions(including carbon) than diesel and petrol. 
            An Post currently has many electric vehicles in its fleet and are also testing the use of alternative fuels sources such as
            Hydro-treated vegetable oil in its heavy goods vehicles.</li>
        <br>
        <li>An Post has also built concept properties. 
            These are test sites used to find the best way to improve their energy efficiency and to lower their emissions.
            For example,An Post will try using different types of energy sources to see which one suits their facilities better.</li>
        <br>
        <li>An Post has installed a biodigester at its Dublin Mail Centre. 
            The Biodigester turns food waste into a by-product that can be used to put vital minerals back into soil.
            It also lowers carbon emissions as there is no need to send the waste to the landfall.</li>
        <br>
        <li>An Post aims for 100 percent of its drivers to have been trained in Eco driving by 2023. 
            Eco Driving is when drivers take certain measures to reduce the emissions their vehicles are producing. 
            For example driving at lower, more consistent speed to save fuel.</li>
        <br>
        <li>An Post is currently testing a new fuel (hydro-treated vegetable oil) in their heavy goods vehicles (e.g. trucks). 
            Hydro-treated vegetable oil releases less emissions than diesel.</li>
        <br>
        <li>An Post has successfully replaced all inside and outside lights with more energy efficient lighting. 
            This allowed them to significantly reduce their annual energy usage. 
            Being more energy efficient helps a company reduce their carbon emissions as well. </li>
    </ol>
