    <h2>A summary of Easyjets's climate activity.</h2>

    <br>
    <hr>

    <h3>Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Rating<sup><a href="#cdp">2</a></sup></h3>

    <p>
        Easyjet currently has a Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) rating of B (Climate Change). 
        A CDP rating is based on how transparent a company is about its climate impact and the actions a company takes to limit
         its climate impact. There are headings for which every company receives a grade such as Water Security and Climate Change.
          There are 8 ratings with (excluding F which means did not disclose) with A being the best. A- is the second highest score. 
          For more information, <a href="glossary.html">click here</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>ISO Certifications</h3>

    <p>
        Easyjet holds ISO 14001 certification. 
        For more information on these ISO certifications <a href="glossary.html">click here</a>.

    </p>
<hr>
    <h3>Stage 2 IEnvA Accreditation</h3>
    <p>
        Easyjet has achieved IATA IEnvA Stage 2 accreditation. 
        This certification is for the aviation industry only and means that the company in question has a management system in place to 
        help the company improve its impact on the environment. 
        For example a company would have to show that it has a system in place that can help prevent water wastage.<sup><a href="#iat">3</a></sup>

<h3>Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050</h3>

<p>
    Easyjet aims to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. 
    This means the Carbon Dioxide being released by Easyjet into the atmosphere equals the amount of Carbon Dioxide taken out of the atmosphere. 
    This can be achieved by firstly reducing Carbon emissions through methods such as switching to renewable energy, 
    then offsetting or removing the remaining emissions. 
    Carbon offsetting means companies supporting a reduction in carbon dioxide or increased absorption of carbon dioxide somewhere in the world.
     Carbon removal means taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere naturally with (trees for example) or with technology and then storing, 
     stopping it from being released into the atmosphere. These are the ways Easyjet intend on achieving this:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Easyjet will increase their use of sustainable aviation fuel. 
        Sustainable aviation fuel can be used in planes and can produce up to 80% less carbon emissions than typical jet fuel over its lifetime.
         Easyjet is also involved in partnerships researching hydrogen fuel which releases zero emissions.<sup><a href="#iat">3</a></sup>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>EasyJet has created a tool that allows customers to voluntarily offset all of the carbon emissions created by their flight or some of 
        the emissions created. This will not reduce the amount of emissions created by the flight but instead the money raised will be used to
         support environmental projects that aim to help reduce carbon emissions in the area they are operating for example. 
         For bookings made between the 19th of November and the end of 2022, Easyjet offsetted their passengers emissions offsetting around
          12 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.

    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Fleet Renewal: This means buying newer planes (new planes generally tend to be more environmentally friendly than their predecessors) 
        to replace older planes. An example of Easyjet's  fleet renewal is Easyjet will purchase at least 157 Airbus aircraft with an option to
         buy 100 more from Airbus (a company that makes aircraft).This deal includes two different types of aircraft with the main one being 
         the Airbus A321neos (101 ordered guaranteed). The Airbus A321neo has more seats, 
         per-seat fuel improvements of up to 20% while also being quieter than its predecessor. 
         The noise reduction of the new aircraft could have less of an impact on birds which can be affected by noise from airports. The main one being bought is the AirbusA321neo. 
        This new aircraft has more seats while still being 20% more fuel efficient and also 50% quieter than its predecessor.<sup><a href="#air">4</a></sup> 
	    The noise reduction caused by the new aircraft could have less of an impact on birds which can be affected by noise from airports.
    </li>
</ol>
	<hr>
	<br>
	    <h1>Reducing Carbon Intensity</h1>
    <p>
	    Easyjet aims to achieve a 35% reduction in carbon intensity by 2030. 
	    Carbon intensity is a way of measuring how clean electricity is used.
	    The lower the carbon intensity is, the less carbon emissions it releases which is better for the environment. Ways to lower a companiesâ€™ carbon intensity is to use cleaner energy sources such as solar energy and green hydrogen instead of natural gas for example.<sup><a href="#ngc">5</a></sup>
