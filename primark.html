    <h2>A summary of Primark's Climate activity.</h2>

    <br>
    <hr>
    <h3>ISO Certifications</h3>

    <p>
        All Primark facilities apart from those in Romania and Slovakia hold the ISO 14001 certification. For more information on ISO certification <a href="glossary.html">click here</a>.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Carbon Emission Reduction</h3>

    <p>
        Primark aims to halve its carbon emissions by 2030. 
        These are the ways that Primark intend on achieving this:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Renewable Energy: Primark aims to make the switch and  use more  renewable energy. Around 70% of stores are powered by renewable or low carbon contracts. This means that the electricity supplier is using either renewable energy or other sources that release small amounts of carbon dioxide. Renewable energy comes from sources such as wind that will never run out and can be used repeatedly. They also produce zero or low amounts of  greenhouse gas emissions. This aim will be achieved by measures that include only buying electricity from companies that use renewable energy sources.
</li> 
        <br>
        <li>Energy Efficiency:  Primark is improving its energy efficiency across the board. This is being achieved by the installation of LED lighting among other measures. LED lighting will be installed in over 55% of stores by the end of 2024. Being more energy efficient is an easy way to reduce both carbon and greenhouse gas emissions.
</li>
        <br>
        <li>Responsible Sourcing:  Primark aims to only use materials that were recycled or sourced from responsible sources by 2030. This means that their suppliers are not having a negative impact on the environment for example. 
</li>
        <br>
        <li>Packaging: Primark aims to remove all single use plastic from their packaging by 2027 as it is terrible for the environment. Primark is also exploring ways to reduce the climate impact packaging needed for different types of products.
</li>   
        <br>
        <li>Waste management: Primark managed to avoid sending 96% of its waste to landfills from the 1st of August 2022 and the 31st of July 2023 . Landfills are considered terrible for the environment. This was achieved through recycling for example.</li>
    </ol>
    <hr>
    <h3>Chemical managment</h3>

    <p>
        Primark has policies in place to ensure that the chemicals in their products are not damaging the environment and that suppliers are not releasing harmful chemicals into the community during production.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Repair workshop program</h3>

    <p>
        Primark are providing workshops that teach people how to mend their own clothes. This allows people to increase their products’ life while also helping to reuse clothes more. These measures are good for the environment. So far, there have been over 100 workshops held in stores.
