    <h2>A summary of Gas Networks Ireland's climate activity.</h2>

    <br>
    <hr>

    <h3>Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Rating<sup><a href="#cdp">3</a></sup></h3>

    <p>
        Gas Networks Ireland currently has a Carbon Disclosure Project(CDP) rating of (B). 
        It aims to increase this to an (A) rating by 2025. A cdp rating is based on how transparent a company is about their climate impact 
        and the actions companies take to limit their climate impact. There are 9 ratings with (F) being the worst and (A) being the best.
        (B) is the third highest score. For more information, <a href="glossary.html">click here</a>.
    </p>

<hr>
    <h3>Zero Waste to Landfills</h3>

    <p>
        Gas Networks Ireland aims to send zero waste to landfills by 2025. 
        Landfills are known for high carbon emissions levels and their negative impact on the local environment. 
        Better alternatives to landfills are to reduce,recycle or reuse waste. 
        One way Gas Networks Ireland intends to achieve this is through recycling office waste.
    </p>
<hr>
    <h3>Contractor Sustainability</h3>

    <p>
        Since 2011, Gas Networks Ireland's largest contractors have had to supply a monthly report based on their sustainability performance. 
        Topics included are energy use and waste management.

    </p>

    <p>
        All of Gas Networks Ireland's largest third party contracts contain financial incentives (for example-a bonus) for 
        contractors who exceed certain environmental targets listed in the contract. This is to encourage contractors to be more environmentally friendly.
    </p>
<hr>
    <h3>Lowering Carbon intensity</h3>

    <p>
        Gas Networks Ireland aims to halve its Carbon intensity by 2030. Carbon intensity is a way of measuring how clean the electricity used is. 
        The lower the carbon intensity is, the less carbon emissions it releases which is better for the environment. Ways to lower a companies' 
        carbon intensity is to use cleaner energy sources such as solar energy and green hydrogen instead of natural gas for example.
    </p>

<hr>
    <h3>Biodiversity Restoration Goals</h3>

    <p>
        Gas Networks Ireland plans to increase the biodiversity at a site in Baldrumman, Dublin. 
        Biodiversity means how diverse the plant and animal life in an area are,high biodiversity levels are wanted by companies. 
        This will be achieved through the planting of over 15,000 native Irish trees and the creation of several habitats such as ponds and bat corridors.
        Not only will this help local biodiversity levels but it will also act as a carbon sink in the future as trees have the ability to remove 
        carbon emissions from the atmosphere. Carbon emissions are harmful to the environment.
    </p>

<hr>
    <h3>Carbon Emission Reduction</h3>

    <p>
        Gas Networks Ireland aims for a net zero carbon gas network for Ireland by 2050. 
        This means that any carbon emissions that the network produces will equal the amount taken away by carbon sinks such as trees 
        (carbon sinks have the ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere). This will be done by reducing and removing emissions.
    </p>

<hr>
    <h3>CNG Station Expansion</h3>

    <p>
        Gas Networks Ireland currently has 4 public Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) stations in Ireland and are aiming to create 2 more. 
        These stations are meant to be used by heavy goods vehicles such as trucks. These stations use CNG which is a cleaner fuel source than petrol and diesel.
    </p>

<hr>
    <h3>Investment in Green Fuel</h3>

    <p>
        Gas Networks Ireland is currently investing in Biomethane and Hydrogen,two alternative fuel sources that are cleaner than natural gas and have
        the potential to replace it in the future.
    </p>

<hr>
    <h3>Net Gain Impact on Biodiversity</h3>

    <p>
        Gas Networks Ireland aims to have a net gain impact on biodiversity by 2025.
        This  means that Gas Networks aim to improve the biodiversity levels on their sites instead of decreasing it. 
        One way Gas Networks Ireland intends to achieve this is by having Tree Felling and Hedge Cutting permits on their sites. This is to 
        protect habitats but still allow them to be cut down if necessary.
    </p>

<hr>
    <h3>Green Work Practices</h3>

    <p>
        At Gas Networks Ireland remote working is possible,employees are encouraged to use public transport if possible and there are cycle to work schemes. 
        All of these are measures that will reduce the companies' carbon emissions.
